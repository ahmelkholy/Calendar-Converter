Import the CSV file (RamadanCSV.csv)
----------------------------------------------
1. Open your calendar application
2. Look for an "Import" option
3. Select the CSV file option
4. Browse to the RamadanCSV.csv file
5. Match the columns to your calendar's format if prompted
6. Select which calendar to add these events to
7. Click Import/OK

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If you continue to experience issues:

1. Try using a different calendar application
2. Make sure dates are in the correct format for your region
3. Import only a few events at first to test
4. Check for special characters that might cause issues
5. Try a different file format (if CSV doesn't work, try ICS or vice versa)
6. Manually add a few key events as a last resort
